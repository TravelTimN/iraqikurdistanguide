                Your booking is confirmed, and a contract exists at the point when We issue a written confirmation that your
                place on a trip has been reserved, following receipt of the applicable deposit amount.
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>

            <h3>2. Cancellation by the Traveller</h3>
            <p>
                Should You wish to cancel your booking, cancellation fees will apply, and are expressed as a percentage of the overall price of the trip.
            </p>
            <p>
                If You cancel the trip:
                <ol>
                    <li type="A">
                        within 7 days of paying your deposit - We will return the full deposit amount
                        (as long the cancellation notice was not received within 15 days of trip departure).
                    </li>
                    <li type="A">
                        after that period, but before 15 days prior to departure - We will retain the full deposit amount (20%).
                    </li>
                    <li type="A">
                        less than 15 days prior to departure - We will retain 100% of the overall trip price.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                Cancellation will only be effective when We receive written confirmation of the cancellation.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Cancellation Process</strong>: To cancel your booking, You must send a written notice to Us by email to
                <a href="mailto:iraqikurdistanguide@gmail.com?subject=Request to Cancel Trip" class="text-kur-green text-break">iraqikurdistanguide@gmail.com</a>.
                Cancellation fees will be applied per person according to the schedule set forth in this section.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Unused trip portion</strong>: If You leave a trip for any reason after it has commenced,
                We are not obliged to make any refunds for unused services. If You fail to join a tour, join it after departure,
                or leave it prior to its completion, no refund will be made.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is strongly recommended that comprehensive travel insurance is taken out which includes cover against cancellation charges.
                Depending on the reason for the cancellation, You may be able to reclaim the cancellation charges (less any applicable excess)
                under the terms of the insurance policy. All claims must be made direct to the insurance company.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Cancellation by Us</h3>
            <p>
                If the Company is forced to cancel your trip, We will let You know with as much notice as possible.
                In these circumstances, You can choose from two options:
                <ol>
                    <li type="A">
                        You can transfer amounts already paid towards another trip on a future date.
                    </li>
                    <li type="A">
                        Receive a full refund.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                This guarantee is not applicable in the case of Force Majeure (see clause 11, below).
                We may cancel a trip at any time prior to departure if, due to terrorism, natural disasters, political instability,
                or other external events, it is not viable for Us to operate the planned itinerary.
                In such circumstances where the cancellation is due to external events outside Our reasonable control,
                refunds will not include any unrecoverable costs.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are not responsible for any incidental expenses that You may have incurred as a result of your booking, including,
                but not limited to, visas, vaccinations, travel insurance excess, or non-refundable flights.
                You are advised only to book fully flexible transport, and other arrangements which can be cancelled or changed without charge,
                and We strongly recommend You have comprehensive travel insurance that includes cancellation coverage.

                An administration fee of $25 USD per person per change will apply, in addition to any charges levied by Our suppliers,
                such as hotels or ground operators. Thereafter all changes will be treated as cancellations, and subject to the charges in clause 3, above.
            </p>
            <p>
                Amendments to any other arrangements made in conjunction with your trip will incur a $25 USD administration fee per booking, per change.

            </p>

                safety, enjoyment, or comfort. Any changes are at the discretion of the Company.
            </p>
            <p>
                This includes the right to replace guides, alter accommodations, change transport, modify the order in which places are to be visited,
                and make any other changes to the itinerary.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will inform You of any such changes as soon as reasonably possible.

                Our trips are led by a guide. The decision of the guide is final on all matters likely to affect the safety or well-being
                of any traveller participating in the trip. If You fail to comply with a decision made by the guide,
                or interfere with the well-being or mobility of the group, the guide may direct You to leave the trip immediately,
                with no right of refund.
            </p>
            <p>

                You grant the Company, its contractors, sub-contractors and assigns, a perpetual, royalty-free, worldwide, irrevocable license to use
                such images for publicity and promotional purposes without any further obligation or compensation payable to You.
            </p>

            <h3>10. Optional Activities</h3>
            <p>
                Optional items not included in the trip price - such as any activity, transportation, meal, product, service,

            </p>

                You accept that any assistance given by your guide in selecting, arranging, or booking optional activities does not
                render Us liable for them in any way. The contract for the provision of that item will be between You and the activity provider.
                If You decide to participate, You do so voluntarily and should take precautions to ensure your own safety.
                We do not guarantee that any optional activity or excursion mentioned on Our Website or marketing materials will
                be available to book during your trip, as these services do not form part of Our contract, and are not under Our control.
                We will not be liable if You cannot, for whatever reason, book any such activity or excursion, or if the activity
                or excursion does not operate as advertised.

                with You is prevented, affected by, or You otherwise suffer any injury, damage, loss, or expense of any nature as
                a result of "force majeure".
            </p>
            <p>
                In these conditions, "force majeure" means any event which We, or the supplier of the service(s) in question, could not,

                mechanical breakdowns, riot, civil strife, terrorist activity, industrial dispute, natural or nuclear disaster,

                Your travel insurance should provide cover against personal accident, death, medical expenses, and emergency repatriation,
                with sufficient coverage amounts for your needs. We also strongly recommend it covers cancellation, curtailment, personal liability,
                and loss of luggage and personal effects.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is your responsibility to ensure that You have sufficient coverage and comply with the terms of the applicable insurance plans.
                You are responsible for understanding the specifics of your travel insurance policy, ensuring that your policy covers all
                optional and included activities listed in the trip itinerary, and ensuring that there are no exclusion clauses that would
                limit the coverage that You might reasonably need.
            </p>
            <p>
                Trip cancellation insurance may be the only means of receiving reimbursement for flights and other non-refundable expenses,
                should the trip be cancelled for any reason, whether voluntarily by You or by the Company.
            </p>

                for the latest entry requirements.

                but without responsibility on the part of the Company. We are not responsible if You are refused entry to the Country
                because You lack the correct passport, visa, or other travel documentation.
