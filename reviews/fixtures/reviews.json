Nothing could be further from the truth.<br /><br />It can&rsquo;t be overstated just how far above my expectations both our guide, Govand, and Kurdistan proved themselves to be. This was, without question, one of the best experiences that I&rsquo;ve had in my extensive travels around the world! The Kurdish people are the warmest, friendliest, and most open people I have met.<br /><br />Govand and Haval&rsquo;s knowledge of the region, coupled with their extensive connections, provided for a trip that took in all the best that Kurdistan has to offer. From the stunning vistas of the Hamilton Road and the gorges and canyons in Rowanduz, the cliff hugging Rabban Hormizd Monastery, to the bustling local life in Erbil, Duhok, and Lalish, the depth of their experience allowed us to fully experience these places in a way that we never could have without them.<br /><br />Thank you, Govand and Haval, for your kindness, openness, and showing us just how wonderful Kurdistan really is. I know that we&rsquo;ve made lifelong friends and I can&rsquo;t wait to come back!</p>",

            "review": "<p>As seasoned travelers, we've been all around the world, including places like North Korea, and without a doubt, our trip to Kurdistan was by far one of the best trips we've ever experienced! The only unfortunate aspect of our trip was that we didn't book a longer journey. We are 3 colleagues/friends from Ireland, and spent a week in Kurdistan during May 2022 (coincidentally during Ramadan/Eid).<br /><br />Haval was already booked for these dates, so we were fortunate enough to be guided by his amazing brother, Govand! The entire nation is so friendly and welcoming, constantly being invited-in by random strangers to eat or have tea with them, everywhere we went. Despite being Eid, it's people like Govand and Haval that make these types of journeys even better; you need someone that carries a high weight of \"wasta\", allowing us entry to places that were either closed for the holidays, or restricted to locals only. The amount of wasta that Govand has in his country is amazing, allowing us rare experiences such as sitting up-front and center with the leader of the Qadiri Sufi Order while dervish men practiced Dhikr to celebrate Eid, having a private tea session with the third-highest Yazidi leader (Baba Chawish) in the holy city of Lalish, and being the only tourists allowed to visit the Rabban Hormizd Monastery during the celebration of remembrance for thousands of Christian Chaldeans/Syriacs/Assyrians after Easter in Alqosh. Truly, it's \"who you know\" (\"wasta\") that allows such experiences, which is why the only way to travel around Kurdistan is with Govand and/or Haval!<br /><br />You'll want to come prepared with a hungry appetite, because meals are thrice daily in huge proportions, yet extremely tasty, and washed down with tea, ayran, and water, so be sure to bring your eatin' pants! The Kurds/Kurdish people are so amazing, and never once did any of us feel unsafe or unwanted. When you travel to other countries and enter places like bazaars, you're almost guaranteed to be pressure-pushed to buy something. In Kurdistan, it's completely the opposite; when someone invites you into their shop at the bazaar, it's because they want you to have some tea with them as their guest, or take pictures and share with your friends back home, purely to show the world and have others learn about their way of life.<br /><br />If it weren't for Govand (and Haval), we definitely would not have had the same experience on our own around this amazing country, and can't wait to return in the future to see our new lifelong friends. Thank you for giving us the chance to learn, laugh, and love!</p>",

No topic of discussion is taboo and he provided so much insight into this region and the people who live within it. His cars were comfortable, well air-conditioned and spacious. It made the car rides a pleasure. He even had all various chargers when our phones or cameras were running out of battery. He truly thinks of everything possible to ensure it is an enjoyable trip. We even had the pleasure of meeting his family for a traditional Eid dinner and we had so much fun with his boys going down to Iskan street. I highly recommend him to anyone interested in visiting Iraqi Kurdistan. Thanks Haval for an incredible trip and the lifelong memories we created together!</p>",

He has a great personality, a really good sense of humor (we were dying laughing in the car and restaurants several times), knows Kurdistan like the back of his hand and knows the history of things really well. Questions aren&rsquo;t off limits to him, and he is someone who is great at giving you insights into Kurdish life and customs.

He is patient and loves photography. For every spot you go to, he knows where to take the best pictures. My social media was way too lit from the pics Haval took of me.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql o9v6fnle ii04i59q\">\r\n<div dir=\"auto\">Lastly, I gained a friend in the process.

We explored several temples, all natural wonders, ancient history of Iraq and Kurdistan, and of course much more! I cannot describe how happy I was. Haval delivered everything we needed and always treated us as friends. We wanted to try some local meals and he always recommended something tasty. We also met his family and his brother Goven who is also a profesional tour guide. Both very friendly and fluent at English.<br />The region of Kurdistan is extremely beautiful and not many foreign tourists there! So if you want to see something wild and unusual, you should definetely ask for Iraqi Kurdistan. Highly recommended!</p>",

            "review": "<p>Haval is an amazing guide for the Kurdish region of Iraq. He is very friendly and very knowledgeable about the places where he takes you. He made me feel very safe and very welcome. The hotels which he reserves for you are very clean and comfortable, the restaurants where he takes you are very good, and his car is very clean as well. He is very flexible so you can do any activities that you might want to do and he was willing to change plans at any time. I had the full Iraqi visa so he was able to take me out of Kurdistan, to go to the city of Kirkuk, which was not on the original schedule. I also got to meet his family, who are also very nice.<br /><br />He was also nice to allow me to reschedule my tour, since I could not come for my original tour date (May 2020).<br /><br />I recommend the full 7-day tour, because he has so many amazing places to take you to.</p>",

            "review": "<p>I'm Mike, from Dublin in Ireland and I travelled to Kurdistan recently with 2 friends, Tim and Chris. I contacted Haval initially who was meticulous with organising the perfect 5 Day itinerary for me around Kurdistan. As Haval already had a tour booked, we were advised that Govand (Haval's brother) was going to be our guide. Govand and Haval were in constant communication with us prior to arrival to ensure we had everything aligned! Govand met us at Erbil International Airport and transferred us to our Hotel. We spent 5 super days exploring Kurdistan, visiting: Erbil, Duhok, Al-qosh, Akre, Amadi, Koya, Rwanduz and Sulemaniyah. Govand has such an excellent sense of humour, he is always punctual, but most of all friendly and very knowledgeable. He has a very evident passion for Kurdistan and shared so much information with us during our trip. It was such a fun and educational trip thanks to him. Govand also kindly invited us into his home where we met Haval and his amazing family and enjoyed such incredible Kurdish hospitality. It was a very memorable occasion and it really proves the kind hearted nature of Govand. I cannot express how impressed and thankful I am for the services provided by Govand and Haval. As a world traveller, I have encountered many, many guides of varying qualities and standards. Govand is simply the best. You cannot and will not find a nicer person who will go the extra mile to help you and advise you. From ordering food, tea, taking photographs, helping with currency exchange - he negotiates everything so you dont need to worry! What a guy! Govand and Haval are now friends for life and I cannot wait to meet them again soon, in fact I am already planning my next trip to Iraq with Haval. If you want a flawless and professional tour, with an added hint of warmth, fun, genuinity, and famous Kurdish hospitality - look no further. These brothers are THE BEST! You will not regret booking a tour with them. I would return in a heart beat!</p>",

            "review": "<p>I contacted Haval via his WhatsApp number and from the very first messages, I knew that he was really good guide and an amazing person. The thing is I was really last minute. I contacted him to organize a daytrip to Lalish village the day before. Even with this tight schedule, Haval made everything to make that happen. He wasn't available but he asked his brother, Govand to guide me. So the morning after, I met Govand at my hotel in Duhok and I'm so glad that I decided to go on a 2 days trip with him! Govand told me everything about Kurdish culture and history. His english was A1 and he really wanted to share his knowledge with me. He also told me everything about the yezidi culture and made my visit to Lalish village (during the Yezidi new year) an amazing experience! In addition, he was really flexible and ask me if I wanted to spend more time at some places. He really care about my confort and my needs. The second day, we went to Saddam Palace, Amedi, Genocide monument and Dore canyon. Again, at every places, he made sure that I had all the information. Overall, the 1 night/2days with Govand was the highlight of my trip to Kurdistan. I usually travel alone by myself but I'm so glad that I chose to hire Haval and Govand for these two days. I must also mention something. I took a shared taxi from Erbil to Dahuk. Unfortunately, I forgot my hat in the taxi. I thought that my hat was lost forever. I told Govand this story and he told me that he would try to find the taxi driver once we get back in Erbil. So, we went to the terminal and ask some drivers and I could finally get my hat back! For me, this story shows how Govand was a amazing guide and also how Kurdish people are one of kind in term of kindness! I cannot recommend you enough to hire Haval and his brother Govand for your next trip to Kurdistan. You will find amazing guide and also friends!</p>",

Najdete tu divokou př&iacute;rodu, hory, kaňony, řeky, vodop&aacute;dy. Ale hlavně pozn&aacute;te neuvěřitelně př&aacute;telsk&eacute; obyvatele a pohostinnost m&iacute;stn&iacute;ch lid&iacute;. Pozn&aacute;te, že je to naprosto bezpečn&aacute; destinace, kde se nem&aacute;te čeho ob&aacute;vat.

Skvěle se tak&eacute; naj&iacute;te.<br />Rozhodně ale doporučuji cestovat s m&iacute;stn&iacute;m průvodcem. Ne kvůli bezpečnosti, ale protože jedině s n&iacute;m budete m&iacute;t &scaron;anci proniknout hlouběji do v&scaron;ech m&iacute;stn&iacute;ch re&aacute;li&iacute;, zaj&iacute;mavost&iacute;, historie, zvyků, kultury, politiky, př&iacute;rody.

Někoho, jako je Haval. Profesion&aacute;l, upř&iacute;mn&yacute;, obětav&yacute; a pokorn&yacute;. S neuvěřitelně bohat&yacute;mi znalostmi cel&eacute;ho regionu ve v&scaron;ech oborech. Kter&yacute; m&aacute; zn&aacute;mosti na v&scaron;ech m&iacute;stech a hladce v&aacute;s provede v&scaron;emi checkpointy, třeba až do hor k &iacute;r&aacute;nsk&yacute;m hranic&iacute;m, kam bychom se sami určitě nedostali.

Je velmi otevřen&yacute; a poděl&iacute; se s v&aacute;mi o svůj životn&iacute; př&iacute;běh, kter&yacute; do velk&eacute; m&iacute;ry kop&iacute;ruje dějiny Kurdist&aacute;nu posledn&iacute;ch 40 let. Nav&iacute;c m&aacute; skvěl&eacute; organizačn&iacute; schopnosti a program m&aacute; skvěle vymy&scaron;len&yacute; a z&aacute;roveň je otevřen&yacute; jak&yacute;mkoliv n&aacute;vrhům a změn&aacute;m.<br />D&iacute;ky Havalovi byla cesta do Kurdist&aacute;nu jedn&iacute;m z m&yacute;ch nejsilněj&scaron;&iacute;ch cestovatelsk&yacute;ch z&aacute;žitků.<br />Kak Haval, supas.

He knows all of the best spots for eating and for other sorts of pleasure. I would give this service 6 stars out of 5 if i could. And would recommend this guide service to any kind of traveller, whether looking for an educational trip to learn about the ancient culture, or just for modern pleasures. Haval will keep you feeling safe. As an American, I was a bit nervous to check out some of the more war-torn areas of Kurdistani Iraq, but was fascinated to see them. Haval provides knowledge of these sites, along with his personal experiences that allow one to really relate with the local people. We became such good friends with Haval, learned so much, and had a life-changing trip overall with this tour guide service. We were sad to leave Kurdistani Iraq.</p>",

He helped each one of us (three ladies) with individual needs, and kept his ears the ground for any safety issues, and he tried to accommodate each one of us throughout the whole trip. Super highly recommended!</p>",
