This is when the snow has all melted, temperature is mostly mild, and the landscape is a beautiful green, which is a pleasant surprise because most tourists don't expect Iraq to be so lush. <strong>April</strong> and <strong>May</strong> are also the months with the most religious celebrations, offering you a nice glimpse into Kurdish culture.</p>\r\n<p>The next best time to visit is during the fall because temperatures are cooler than the summer. However, like summertime, the landscape will be more dry and brown.</p>\r\n<p>Winter is the most difficult time to travel around Iraqi Kurdistan due to snowfall, particularly in the mountains. Because of this, some attractions might be closed,&nbsp;or impossible to get to.</p>",

Winters in Kurdistan are cold, with average temperatures that are often close to freezing. In contrast, the summers are sweltering with temperatures easily reaching 45&deg;C (113&deg;F) or higher daily. Spring and Autumn are the most pleasant times to visit.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many religious sites require that you dress modestly, and this may include covering your legs (pants or long dress) as well as wearing a headscarf for women. The Yazidi holy site of Lalish requires that everyone remove their shoes while visiting, so you will be walking barefoot (or with socks). Important considerations if the weather is very hot or very cold/snowy!</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Should you wish to take advantage of the many trails and hiking opportunities that the region has to offer, be sure to pack appropriate footwear.</span></p>",

            "answer": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crime rates in Kurdistan are very low, so there is a low risk of anything happening to your belongings, should you take the precautions you normally would when travelling. It is common to hear of people leaving phones or bags in a restaurant or tea house, and returning hours later to find them still there.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many hotels also offer in-room safes, but theft from your room would be exceptionally rare. In fact, previous clients of mine tried to leave a tip for housekeeping, and upon returning from our day out travelling, found that housekeeping left the money with a note to say they were concerned that the guests accidentally dropped the money on the way out the door!</span></p>",

            "answer": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can keep your money about you in a wallet or purse, as you normally would, without fear that it will be taken. If you have larger amounts of cash on you, then you may wish to take extra precautions such as keeping it in an inaccessible zip pocket, or deeper part of a purse or backpack. Try to not carry more money on you than you reasonably need for the day.</span></p>",

This means that we can make appropriate recommendations for accommodation, and plan day trips with insulated bags to keep your medication cool.</span></p>",

Some of the best physicians in the country have migrated to Kurdistan in recent years, and the standard of care is high. This being said, the public system is very busy, and access to care can be slow. The quickest access to care, should you need it, is through the private system, so it is important that you have adequate travel insurance, and that the level of cover provided can meet your needs.</span></p>",
